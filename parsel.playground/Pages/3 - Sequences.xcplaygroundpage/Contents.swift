 One of the missing feature in the calculator we built in the [previous](@previous) page was that it only could process two operands per operation.
 
 In this page we are going to use operators that allow us to produce more values at once!
 
 ## Sequences üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß
 
 Imagine you would like to parse an input string that contains comma separated numbers.
 
 `rep` tries to parse the parser as long as it succeeds and returns all produced values in an array. You can also give it an optional separator.
 */
let csn = L.decimalNumber.rep(sep: L.char(","))
try csn.parse("1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9").unwrap()
/*:
 To avoid empty lists you can use the `atLeastOne` or `atLeastOnce(sep:)` functions:
*/
let digits = L.digit.atLeastOne
try digits.parse("123").unwrap()
try digits.parse("a").error()
/*:
 If you need an exact count of successes you can use the `exactly(count:)` function.
 */
let zipCode = L.digit.exactly(count: 5)
try zipCode.parse("01259").unwrap()
try zipCode.parse("12").error()
/*:
 ## Optionals ?
 
 Since every parsing operation could fail, we can also provide a fallback if that happens:
 */
let couldFail = L.digit.fallback(0)
try couldFail.parse("a").unwrap()
try couldFail.parse("3").unwrap()
/*:
 To avoid magic numbers that represent the absence of a value Swift provides the `Optional` type. The success of a parser is sometimes optional as well:
 */
let optionalNumber = L.digit.optional
try optionalNumber.parse("a").unwrap()
try optionalNumber.parse("3").unwrap()
